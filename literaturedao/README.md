# Literature Dao

This app provides sharing, indexing, and searching of scientific publications in p2p networks.

## Features

- Peers in the LiteratureDao community can upload literature in .PDF format
- The uploaded files get parsed and extracted information (keywords)
- The extracted information can be searched locally
- Peers keep sharing their local literature with their neighbors and download random literature shared by their neighbors
